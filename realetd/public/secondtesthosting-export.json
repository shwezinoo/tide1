      "AbstractThesis" : "Today, Information Technology (IT) is rapidly improving and then large-scale availiable data and information is demanded by information socieity. To grt relevant and related information, efficient Information Reteieval (IR) system which is needed provides advanced searching facilities. To organize large information  repositories efficiently, metadata can be used. Closely related to metadata is ontology.Ontology is a formal explicit description of concepts in a domain of discourse, properties of each concept descripting various feactures and attributes of the concept, and restrictions on slots. This thesis is intented to present the feactures and benefits of the IR system by applying ontology concepts and also point out how metadata is critical in supporting effictive discovery. This system is implemented by using Java, XML and Java APi for RDF clled Jena package.",

      "AbstractThesis" : "By means of images processing, the  objects contained in  a two dimensional (2D) images can be extracted object by object. The types of the objects can then be recognized or  identified. The object extraction as well as recognition is useful for many different application, such as machine vision, industrial insperation tasks, pick and place operations. Extraction and Recognition of objects from 2D images has been proposed in several methods. For the extraction of the objects from 2D images, among the various extraction methods, component labeling technique is applied in this thesis. For the recognition of a certain object, template maching (historgram matching) technique is applied since the component labeling and template matching methods are simple and effective. The histograms of various objects are previously stored in the histogram database in order to be ready for histogram matching. The histogram of the object in interest is also built up by the system. This histogram has to be matched with the histograms in the histogram database. By means of the template matching technique, the type of the extracted objects has to be recognized.",

      "AbstractThesis" : "The system is based on the compiling techniques concept. A compiler accepts high levels languages program and produces object code. A compiler first  analyzes the source program and breaks it into its  constituent parts. Its then synthesizes the object program by using th information gathered during the analysis phase. Syntax analyzer or parser is the second part of the compiler. Parser obtains a string of tokens from lexical analyzer and verifies that string can be generated by the grammar for the source language and produce as output a syntax tree to use for the source language and produce as output a syntax tree to use for semantic analysis. The system will use the parsing techniques. The two parsing methods are top down and  button up  parsing methods. This thesis is intended to study a top down parsing method that can be applied to construct a top down parser and to check syntax errors in the program. And, this system displayed the correct and error messages for syntax errors in this program. It is implemented by using Java language.",

      "AbstractThesis" : "Cluster technology has been increasingly popular and is being used in various kinds of applications, but many of which are not tolerant to system failures and resulting loss of service.\n Failover clustering is a backup operational mode in which the function of a system component (such as a processor, server, network, or database , for example) is assumed by secondary system components when the primary component becomes unavailable through either failure or scheduled downtime. To make system more fault-tolerant, failover is typically an integral part of mission-critical systems that must be constantly available.\n This thesis is focused on two node failover clustering system as active/passive model. There are two servers in the LAN which are running file servers. The cluster monitors the status of file services and network. In monitoring process, it uses heartbeat signal. If the active server fails functioning, a process called failover automatically for critical applications and data. This system can provide file transferring services with high availability .

Statistics show that a significant part of Web text information is encoded in Web images. Since Web images have special characteristics that sometimes distinguish them from other types of images , commercial Optical Character Recognition (OCR)engine often fails to recognize Web images due to their special key characteristics and may contain non-text images which are the graphic regions. This thesis proposes a background elimination algorithm that aims to locate text areas\n and prepare them for ORC procedure with the best results. To perform text area identification, color reducing, binarization, connected labeling, noise canceling and pattern classifying steps are carried out. The 8-connected component algorithm is applied to the binary image in order t get individual components. The average ratio of sizes of the individual components as well as the number of change horizontally of the pixels values is the main fact and factor to identify out the text area. In this thesis , the pure text images have to be fined out and extracted from the Wed image contained both ? and graphic regions . MATLAB programming language is used to implement this thesis.",

In MCDM problems, a decision maker is to select the best alternative among a set of alternatives with respect to the selection criteria. This system intends to implement the decision supporting tool, which use the AHP method. Firstly, the criteria and alternatives among a set of alternatives is chosen from the system using Multi Criteria Making (MCDM). Finally, any problem with multi criteria can be easily solved by this system.\n Decision whether to buy or to rent a machine is used as example in this system. The decisions for buy or rent are made by using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP).",

The optimized objective for job partitioning is to balance the workload among nodes and to minimize the interprocess communication needs. The load sharing problem is to develop process scheduling algorithms to transfer processes automatically from heavily loaded computers to lightly loaded computers. Its primary goal is to ensure that no processor is idle while there are processes waiting for services in other processors.\n In this thesis, Dynamic Shipment  Stability (DDS) System is constructed by using agent technology to implement efficient load balancing on computing cluster nodes. The DSS system is designed to control all slave nodes from the master for evenly distributing workloads among processor. The key feature of DSS includes evaluation of parallel tasks on behalf of the user. Some parallel scientific applications are implemented with a balancing algorithm to give the sampler results of the system. This mobile agent-based system is attracted with high flexibility, low network traffic and high asynchrony.",

The future of e-government will depend in part on the ability of governments to manage their Web sites in a more effective and efficient way to deliver value to citizens. The standard architecture (HTML) for most existing sites presents serious limitations for managing complex Web sites. A viable alternative to an HTML-based Web site is one rooted in XML.

The object of study in game theory is the game, which is formal\n model of an interactive situation. A game consists of a set of players, a set of moves available to those players and a specification of payoffs for each combination of strategies. There are two types of game theory: classical game theory and combinatorial game theory. In combinatorial game theory, there are two types of games: partisan game and impartial game. An impartial game is a game in which the allowable moves depend only on the position and not on which of the two-player is currently moving. Impartial games include one of the NIM game. The game of NIM typically involves two players and heaps of objects. Players alternate in making a move, by removing some objects from one of the piles, eg, at least one object, possibly the entire heap. In combinatorial game theory, there is a minimax algorithm for game solutions. Using minimax algorithm, the NIM game can be represented as game tree and used to find the optimal game solution. The aim of this system is how to play NIM game and how to search optimal decision for NIM game tree using minimax algorithm in combinatorial game theory.",

If a car arrives at the ENTRY barrier, the sensor senses and then the program checks and counts a car. If the count is greater than or equal to 100, the car park is full and message \"FULL\" is displayed. When the car park is full, the lock mechanism is activated. If a car leaves from the car parking, the EXIT barrier opens and then the count is decreased. The lock mechanism is disabled as soon as spaces are available in the car park. If the count is less than 100, then it is assumed that there is space in the car parking and the message \"SPCE\" is displayed. The numbers of car are displayed on the monitor.

But, the increasing volume of data in modern business and science calls for computer-based approaches. AS data sets have grown in size and complexity, the modern technologies of computers, networks, and sensors have made data collection and organization an almost effortless task. However, the captured data are needed to be converted into information and knowledge from recorded data to become useful. Data mining technique is evolved as a powerful tool for knowledge. There are many analysis techniques under data mining field. Among them, regression method is very useful to predict the discrete data. Using regression, unknown variable can be predicted based on known variable. This thesis is intended to develop a prediction tool based on linear and multi-linear regression. The system is aimed to use for interpretation of climate, mainly prediction temperature (�F) and rainfall (inches). To calculate output climate zone, the coldest temperature must be filled. To calculate output hemisphere, temperature must be filled for January and July. To calculate output temperature condition, the hottest and coldest temperatures must be filled. To calculate output precipitation condition, more rainfall side must be filled and hemisphere must be reused. To calculate output climate, total year rainfall must be filled and climate zone must be reused. To calculate output distance from sea, temperature condition must be filled.",

      "AbstractThesis" : "Multi-agent systems have emerged as one of the most important areas of research and development in information technology. A multi-agent system is composed of multiple interacting software components known as agents, which are typically capable of cooperating to solve problems that are beyond the abilities of any individual member. Multi-agent systems are important primarily because they have been found to have very wide applicability, in areas as diverse as industrial process control and electronic commerce. This system is based on the multi-agent system to estimate the cost of a specific home building. It includes slave agents that estimate the cost of a specific home type and then send to master agent. Slave agents use cost estimation methods to estimate the budget. Master agent shows the costs of the home from slaves comparatively. As in real world marketplace, this system can negotiate using reverse auction method. The primary goal of this system is to make expertise available to builders of new home who need to buy, with varieties of information quickly. The programming language for implementing this system is ASP.NET (web programming) and Microsoft SQL server 2005 (database programming). The operating  system used for running this system is Windows Platform (Windows XP or Window Server 2003).",

      "AbstractThesis" : "Today, Information Technology (IT) is rapidly improving and then , large-scale available data and information is demanded by information society. To get relevant and related information, efficient Information Retrieval (IR) system is needed to provide advanced searching facilities. The purpose of the IR system is to capture the desired items and to filter\nout the unwanted items. Size of digital image collection grows\nexponentially. Thus, efficient image retrieval is becoming increasingly important. To organize large information repositories and access these repositories efficiently, metadata can be used. Closely related to metadata is ontology. Ontology is a formal explicit description of concepts in a domain of discourse, properties of each concept describing various features and attributes of the concept, and restrictions on Ontology-based image retrieval has the potential to fully describe the  semantic content of an image. This thesis is intended to present the features and benefits of the IR system by applying ontology concepts and also point out how metadata is critical in supporting effective discovery. This system is implemented by using Java, HTMI, (Hyper Text Markup Language), JSP (Java Server Pages) and Java API for RDF) (Resource Description Framework) called Jena package.",

Any visitor will not interest too long on the road, they want to take the shortest tour for his desired trip. At the point , Visitor Guide System can support as a guide without asking guide. This proposed system is intended to evaluate the visitor guide system for interesting places of district in Myanmar, in which suggests two-pass control structure on a three vertical layer architecture and multi-agent systems that consist of a collection of functional agent. An agent can be used to select action in environments that are deterministic, observable and completely known, The agent can construct sequences of actions that achieve its goals.\nIn the visitor guide system, such system would facilitate cooperation and increases its effectiveness and also serve as a basic development of visitor guide. This system helps to obtain the shortest path from one district to another district. The visitor guide system uses A* search for minimization of total distance or cost. In this thesis , Visitor Guide System (VGS) takes places to be visited with selected route and source to destionation route to find the shortest path by using the A* search strategy without time-comsuming. A* search is one kind of heuristically informed search strategy that reduces the search cost. This system is implemented by using C# programming language on ASP.NET platform.",

Images can be reconstructed with high accuracy even when there are thousand of fragments and multiple images involved.\nIn this thesis, a method is proposed for reassembling two fragments. This method is based on the border distances and color information extracted from the fragments. This information is used in image reconstruction. Firstly, the feature points of the border distances of the fragments. If the border distances of the fragments are the same, next stage is to match the color of these fragments. This method is applied to reconstruct an image by combining these same border distances and color of the fragments. Finally, the complete reconstructed image is attained.\nIn this thesis, implementation is to be developed by using MATLAB(R2008b) programming language.",

      "AbstractThesis" : "The process of grouping a set of physical or abstract objects into classes of similar object is called clustering. A cluster is a collection of data objects that are similar to one another within the same cluster and are dissimilar to the objects in other clusters. Document clustering is to cluster a set of text documents. Fast and high quality document clustering is a crucial task in organizing information, search engine results, enhancing web crawling, and information retrieval or filtering. Recent studies have shown that the most commonly used partitioning-based clustering algorithm, the K-means algorithm, is more suitable for large datasets. However, the K-means algorithm can generate a local optimal solution. In this thesis work, Harmony K-means (HKA) algorithm is used to avoid this shortcoming. The algorithm deals with document clustering based on harmony search optimization method that finds near global optimal clusters. In clustering documents, these documents are firstly represented as vectors. That is, the document is represented by the frequency of the words that make up the document. And then, the system uses HKA to generate solution vectors in harmony memory and calculate average distance of documents to the cluster centroids (ADDC) value for each solution. Then, the system improvises new solution and calculates ADDC value. The generated solution is replaced with a row in harmony memory if the new solution has better fitness value than those in HM. This system is implemented by using Visual C# in Visual Studio 2005.",

However, personalization services must be improved to lighten user�s burden in the process of personalization and produce results that are more adaptable. As one of the most promising approaches to improve the current personalized services, recommender systems have emerged in domains such as E-commerce, digital libraries. In this work, I firstly attempted to apply a recommender system in the field of E-commerce applications. Then, I decided to build a recommender system for ladies� wear personalization services to make it more user-friendly and user-adaptive. One of the most successful technologies for recommender system is collaborative filtering. The bottleneck in conventional collaborative filtering algorithm (such as traditional user-based algorithm) is the search for neighbors among a large user population of potential neighbors. This system uses item-based algorithm to avoid this bottleneck. The algorithm explores the relationships between items first rather than the relationship between users. Because the relationships between items are relatively static, item-based algorithms may be able to provide the same quality as the user-based collaborative filtering method and the system is implemented by using Net Beans Application and JAVA.",

Nature of the light in actual world is simulated by using the three types or components of light: ambient, diffuse and specular. Effects of these lighting components are then calculated using the lighting models and then results are analyzed. Comparison is done with the calculation results via the visualization effects.

Experiments show that these two algorithms are effective for 200 records with fourteen attributes of optical mineralogy datasets and become more and more effective as the number of clusters increases. The k-Medoids method is more robust than k-Means in the presence of noise and outliers because a medoid is less influenced by outliers or other extreme values than a mean.

The parallel port�s output is running the speed sensing module to read the current speed measured by the total delay time. Different speed is defined as the different delay time. The delay time is also replied from the input data to the parallel port. By this way, it can be know that the speed of the DC motor is slow or medium or fast. If the delay time is short, the DC motor speed is fast. If the delay time is very long, the DC motor speed control for moving object has slow speed.

Conversely, recommendation system helps the business by generating more sales. It is rapidly becoming an essential tool in E-commerce on the web. The most popular recommendation methods are content-based filtering and collaborative filtering method. In content-based filtering method, the items are recommended based on the past user�s preferences. So, it can recommend the new item that is similar to the user�s preference item. But it has a cold start problem for new user. In collaborative filtering method, the items are recommended based on similar users� preferences. So, it can solve the cold start problem for new user. But it cannot recommend any new item until other similar users have not rated on it. In this thesis, recommendation system is developed based on hybrid approach. And then, hybrid approach is created by combining the content-based filtering method and collaborative filtering method. So, this system can solve the cold start problem, can recommend the new item and eliminates weaknesses found in each approach. Moreover, it can provide more accurate recommendation than other methods.

      "AbstractThesis" : "The continuous growth in the sized and use of the World Wide Web imposes new methods of design and development of online information services. Most web structures are large, complicated and users often miss the goal of inquiry, or receive ambiguous results when users try to navigate through them. Collaborative filtering is one of the most frequently used techniques in  personalized recommendation systems. Recommender systems use ratings from users on items that have not been rated. Predictions are normally done by using the ratings of other users of the system, by learning the user preference as a function of the features of the items by collaborative filtering method. \nMemory-based collaborative filtering is used in this movie recommender system. First of all, the user has to give rating what he likes in the movie he has seen. It depends on that rating to find out the neighbors of an active user by using Pearson correlation coefficient method. To predict the movies that the active user has not seen depends on neighbors of the active user and the highest rating will be shown as recommended movie list.",

Network Management in general consists of two activities: monitoring and controlling. The monitoring part concerns obsering and analyzing the status and behavour of the managed network, and is therefore fundamental for network management. Network monitoring is a vital part of modern network infrastructure management. To monitor packet between client and server in a LAN networks, monitoring theories are needed to inform management systems about critical events. Nowadays, Information Technology(IT) is renowned and famous. At the present period of time, it is important to get more information than others quickly and accurately. It is important to share individual data and information with other in client-server system as well. The data and information are sent in packet from in TCP/IP. This approach allows users to customize the monitoring function to suit a wide range of monitoring needs: the system uses poeration system maecharisms dthat result in a programming enviranment.

Min-Max normalization is used to find the distance between the objects.Clusters that have the smallest distance merge into a cluster. To update distance, single linkage clustering is used. Agglomerative clustering starts with each object as a separate cluster and merges them into successively latger clusters until all of the objects are in a single cluster ot until certain termination conditions are satisfied.

In incomplete decision tables, two different types of missing attribute values are interpreted as lost and �do not care� conditions. In this system, attribute-value pair blocks serve as a main vehicle for computing characteristic sets, lower and upper approximations. Among three different possibilities to define lower and upper approximations, this system uses concept approximations. On the basis of the approximations, certain and possible rules are induced by using rule induction algorithm LEM2 (Learning from Examples Module, version2), and a component of LER2 (Learning from Examples based on Rough Set).

An image-based data requires more effort during encryption and decryption. Encryption involves applying special mathematical algorithms and keys to transform original data into cipher code before original data are transmitted. Decryption involves the application of mathematical algorithms and keys to get back the original data from cipher code. This system applies an approach of block permutation for image encryption. In this technique, the image can be decomposed into blocks. A group of blocks is taken from the image and these blocks are permuted (that are rearranged within the image) with the user-defined key. From the results, the smaller block size should be lower for better encryption. This system is implemented using C# programming and Microsoft SQL Server 2005",

Therefore, managers need survey research tools that can predict what customers will choose when faced with the variety of brands available and myriad product characteristics. The system that will be present supports the manager to know which computer brands and attributes are chosen most by using Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis. This system implements the three stages of Choice Based Conjoint Analysis to know the most chosen computer brand and attributes. Firstly, the user of the system must ask questions to the target peoples. And then, the answers data are collected as the second stage. Finally, the data collected in second stage are analyzed. This system also measures the utility of the product; therefore, manager can know how to control the stock level of the existing product and estimate the preferences of customers by using this utility value of the product. This system can analyze market survey data that have already been collected from customers. By using this system, manager can save time, money and other resources to research the preferences of customers.

Thus, gathering and retrieving distributed information is now a widely used application. By moving to the location of an information resource, the agent can search the resource locally, eliminating the transfer of intermediate results across the network and reducing end-to-end latency. Mobile agent technology has the ability to travel from one host to another in a network. Therefore, we build mobile agent-based parallel information retrieval system in order to provide user�s desired information from distributed sites simultaneously. This system intends not only sites/shops to publish their product catalogue simultaneously according to the user�s request but also user to find the preferences shop to make his/her purchases. In this system, when the user gives the input, distributed query is processed parallel on each site by using parallel mobile agent. Then, the result which is the product information is returned to user. It not only supports activities of users but also facilitates parallel processing. The latter is important as more sites/shops can be searched in a shorter time to provide users with better choices in their decision-making.

The he push/pull operations are accomplished by means of switching transistors. The switching sequeces of these transistor switches is pulse width modulation (PWM).A microcontroller, PIC is used to generate this switching sequence. Alternative PWM  switching causes the output of the transformer to be high step sine waves with PWM ripples. By means of LC filtering on these ripples, the  pure sine wave is acquired.

Stemming Algorithms are used in many applications such as Information Retrieval (IR), Natural Language Processing and many Data Mining fields. So, stemming algorithms are very useful in commercial and theoretical field. There are various stemming algorithms which differ in the way of processing, in respect of performance and accuracy. So. it is important to know which stemming algorithm is the Sest algorithm in their related application. In this thesis, the stemming in Information Retrieval are focused on. This system evaluates the effects of stemming algorithms in IR and also evaluates the result among stemming algorithms. Firstly, four IR systems with different stemming algorithms and a baseline IR is constructed without using any stemming algorithm. These IR the same indexing and searching technique. And, the system uses the same test collection which has certain documents, queries and relevant sets that are the information relation between document and query. And then, the system saves the output results of each query with systems. Then, the system evaluates the stemming algorithms with tree evaluation techniques: 1.) Average Precision at 11-Recall Point measure, 2) Average Precision at certain Document Level and 3.) age Recall at certain Document Level according to their save results relevant lists. Finally, the evaluated results of five IR systems are plotted on the araph to decide what system is the best system compared the result of baseline IR system.

This thesis presents a vision system which recognizes facial expressions and applies back-propagation neural network which partially emulates human thinking.\n\tFirst, the input face image is cropped manually to obtain only face part of the whole image. And then, the cropped image is loaded to the system. As the system is based on facial features such as eyes, eyebrows and mouth to recognize facial expressions, it uses thresholding, histogram equalization, and mathematical morphology to extract precise edges of these features. And 30 facial characteristic points are defined to describe the position and shape of three features. Facial expressions can be described by combining different action units which are specified by the basic muscle movements of the human face. This system uses six main action units as the input vectors of neural network-based expression classifier trained by back-propagation neural network to recognize.",

Existing information retrieval (IR) systems can result in failure to find relevant  documents that refer to the place of interest because it treats locative terms in the same way as other terms. This can be overcome by using hybrid index structures: text indexing and geo-scope indexing. In this thesis, a system is developed to realize the use of text indexing and geo-scope indexing as a hybrid index structure to retrieve documents. The system allows user to create queries with three parts: textual terms, spatial relationship and locative concept. The system extracts user�s interesting textual terms from the query and indexes them. Then, spatial relation and locative concept extracted from the query are indexed by using Geographical Knowledge Base (GKB). Finally, the system intersects the resultant documents retrieved by text indexing and geo-scope indexing to achieve relevant information to the user�s location-based query.

Consequently, the volume of XML data is explosively increasing: The need for efficient mechanisms of XML data management is vital. There are many different ways to store XML document. XML data can be stored in a file system, an object-oriented database system, a relational database system or an XML database system. A file system could not provide any support for querying the XML data. Object- oriented database system is not mature enough to process complex queries on large databases. In this thesis work, relational database is used for XML storage because the relational database systems are mature and scale very well, and they have the additional advantage. In order to store XML document in a relational database, there is a need to map the data available in XML into database. This system deals with the storing of student�s data written in XML format into relational database by using schema mapping and data mapping algorithm. Firstly, input XML document is parsed. Secondly, schema mapping algorithm is used to generate a document schema. Finally, data mapping algorithm is used to store all extracted information as tuples into relational tables. By using these mapping algorithms, the system can also store student data of other universities that are written in XML format and documents of other applications such as books, purchase order XML documents. This system also provides effective query from the relational database by using Standard Query Language (SQL).",

Min-Max normalization is used to normalize fruit data. The Euclidean distance function is used to find the distance between the objects. Clusters that have the smallest distance merge into a cluster. To update distance, single linkage clustering is used. Agglomerative clustering starts with each object as a separate cluster and merges them into successively larger clusters until all of the objects are in a single cluster or until certain termination conditions are satisfied.

In the real world, some of the already clustered documents may not be of importance while new documents of more significance may evolve.\n        In this system, the text documents are initially clustered into k clusters by using K-means clustering and for each cluster, a statistics structure called Cluster Profile (CP) is created. The Cluster Profile cooperates with the Fading Function. The properties of Cluster Profile are additivity, updatability, and fading. Fading Function keeps an account of the time-dependent importance of the cluster.\n        Before adding the new documents, the system calls the Merge algorithm to set the k cluster according to the fading factor value and check the similarity between them. And then, the newly text document is assigned to the most similar cluster. If there is no cluster similar to the newly text document, it will delete inactive cluster and create new cluster with deleted cluster�s id and all Cluster Profiles are updated. Finally, if there are no new income documents, the fading factor value of all Cluster Profiles are calculated by using Fading Function to display the activity statuses of clusters.

The usefulness of binary arithmetic coding (that is, coding with a 2-symbol alphabet) is pointed out, and the modeling issue, particularly high-order modeling for text compression is discussed. The main focus is on encoding, but the decoding process is similar. For each symbol of the file, the current interval is subdivided into subintervals, one for each possible alphabet symbol. The size of a symbol�s subinterval is proportional to the estimated probability that the symbol will be the next symbol in the file, according to the model of the input. The subinterval corresponding to the symbol that actually occurs next in the file is selected, and the new current interval is made. Enough bits are output to distinguish the final current interval from all other possible final intervals. Arithmetic coding is a method for lossless data compression. Normally, a string of characters such as the words �hello there� is represented by using a fixed number of bits per character, as in the ASCII code. Arithmetic coding is a form of variable-length entropy encoding that converts a string into another form that represents frequently used characters using more bits, with the goal of using fewer bits in total.",

Agents interact with each other using Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agent defined Agent Communication Language (FIPA-ACL) and Query interaction protocol. By using this system, the user gets the result indicating whether the import is allowed or not, and saves time-consuming. This system provides the amount of previous export and import at all border trade area and the reason of allowance with detailed calculation.

This system helps the user to plan evening activities, composing entertainment services such as cinemas and restaurants. In this system, forty restaurants and five cinemas located in four townships of Mandalay are used. This system applies Personal Assistant Agent (PAA) and Evening Organizer Agent (EOA) to provide evening plan. The PAA communicating with the user through the graphical user interface helps to find restaurants and cinemas and get information about them. The EOA receives the inputs from the PAA and produces evening plan based on user data such as starting point, start time, cuisine and movie type. The system finds the nearest restaurant from the starting point depending on the desired cuisine and the cinema based on movie type. The system produces the most appropriate evening plan according to the user's desire. This system is developed by using Java Software Development Kit (J2SE7), Tomcat Server 5.5, Java Agent Development Framework (JADE 3.6) and MySQL database.",

In this systems,public key algorithm ELGamal and symmetric cipher LOKI will be combined together to develop the efficient digital envelope system. The mass volume of data will be encrypted by using symmetric cipher LOKI in the favor of the processing time and then the secret key used for LOKI will be encrypted by using the public key cipher ELGamal to solve the key distribution problem.",

In the areas of statistics (mixture models), computer science (Data Mining, machine learning, nearest neighbor search), pattern recognition, and vector quantification, there is still a lot of work being done. This system represents development of clustering system using K-means method. K-Means is one of the most popular clustering algorithms. It is best suited for implementing this operation because of its efficiency in clustering large data sets. It is also simple and fairly fast. K-Means is initialized form some random or approximate solution. Each iteration assigns each point to its nearest cluster and then poiiits belonging to the came cluster are averaged to get new cluster centroids. Each iteration successively improves cluster centroids until they become stable. This system is implemented by K-Means algorithm with Flag data set. According to the use of well known Flag data set, the algorithm has demonstrated a very good classification performance. The accuracy is tested with different k-value. Experiments will show that the algorithm is scalable in terms of both the number of clusters and the number of records.",

In some applications where a two-way communication link exists between the sender and the receiver, the receiver may inform the sender that a message has been received in error and, request a repeat of that message. An error control system in which the erroneously received messages are simply retransmitted is called Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ). This is an error control technique whereby an error detection scheme is combined with requests for retransmission of erroneous data. Every block of data received is checked by using, the error detection code applied, and if the check fails, retransmission of the data is requested � this may be done repeatedly, until the data can be verified. Error detection is the detection of errors caused by noise or other impairments during transmission from the transmitter to the receiver. Error correction is the detection of errors and reconstruction of the original, error-free data. This system utilizes Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) for error detection and stop-and-wait ARQ technique for error correction.
